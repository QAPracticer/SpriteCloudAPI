API practice

Just my attempt to make the testcase for API exam.
Test cases implemented:
  1. Retrieved a list of users
  2. Performed a successful login
  3. Performed an update
  4. Performed a deletion
  5. Executed 2 negative scenarios of your choice
  6. Executed a parameterized delayed request (max 3 seconds) and evaluated how long the request takes.
